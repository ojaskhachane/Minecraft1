<p> My favourite game is minecraft. Minecraft is an open world sandbox video game originally made by Markus "Notch" Persson. 
It was run by a company called Mojang before being sold to Microsoft in 2014 for USD $2.5 billion. 
It is the best-selling video game of all time, and over 200 million copies of the game have been sold. Minecraft is a game where the player uses their imagination to shape the world around them using the resources they find. In the world everything is shaped like a block or a cube, this includes the trees, the dirt, the water, the clouds, even the sun, everything. This simple game hasn’t even been released yet but has already sold over one million copies. Minecraft was created by one man, Markus “Notch” Persson, and this is his story. What makes the story of Minecraft so unique is that it was created by Notch and only Notch. Notch had a job before Minecraft, working on games for a company.

Minecraft makes $250,000 a day and  continues to do so. On June 13, 2011, Minecraft passed 2.5 million sales. Today Mojang has 10 employees. Markus Persson, Jens Bergensten, Daniel Kaplan, Junkboy, Jakob Porser, Carl Manneh, Tobias Mollstam, Aron Neiminen, Daniel Frisk, and Daniel Rosenfeld. These few people make up the team that continues to work towards Minecraft’s future. But with so few employees things take time. Even though the game has not been officially released, people who buy the game get a copy of what it is right now as the updates are being pushed out. With such success Mojang is the target of some heavy criticism from blogs, critics, and even their own fans. One speculation from fans is that Minecraft will be the company’s 1 hit wonder. What happens if it truly is a one hit wonder? </p>
